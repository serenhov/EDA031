### Instructions ###

The program is compiled and built with `make`. `make install` moves the executables to the _bin_ directory. `make clean` removes the object files and executables and clears the database. 

To run the server execute: `./run_server port-number server-version`. Here server-version should be _mem_ for the in-memory version and _disk_ for the disk version. 

To run the client execute: `./client hostname port-number`.
